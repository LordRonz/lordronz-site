# Building a Real-Time Feed System (From Frontend to Backend)

How I accidentally designed a fullstack micro-architecture just to push new
posts to the top.

## 🧠 Background

What started as a simple frontend project to display posts in a feed turned into
an unexpected journey into system design. I wanted one thing: when a new post is
made, users should see a “🔄 New posts available” button, just like Twitter.

The simplest idea? Polling. The better idea? Server-Sent Events. The fun idea?
Let's architect a real-time event-driven system with RabbitMQ.

## 🏗️ Overview of the Architecture

Let's walk through what happens when someone posts a feed item:

1. Client sends a `POST /feeds` request.
2. API inserts into PostgreSQL and publishes an event to RabbitMQ.
3. A separate consumer service picks up that event and broadcasts it via
   Server-Sent Events (SSE) to connected clients.

It's decoupled, real-time, and scalable. Here's how I built it.

## 🧩 Tech Stack

- Frontend: Next.js (App Router), TanStack Query, Tailwind, shadcn/ui
- Backend API: Go + net/http
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Event Queue: RabbitMQ
- Real-time Layer: Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- Infra: Docker (RabbitMQ, Postgres)

## 🔧 Feed Insertion Flow

API (Go) handles POST /feeds, inserts into the DB, and publishes a FeedCreated
event to RabbitMQ:

```go
_ = queue.PublishFeedCreated(queue.FeedEvent{
  ID:      feedID,
  Content: req.Content,
  Author:  req.AuthorID,
  Time:    createdAt.Unix(),
})
```

This decouples DB writes from broadcasting logic.

## 📨 Event Broadcasting with RabbitMQ + SSE

A separate consumer service listens to the feed.created queue and uses an
in-memory SSE pool to push to all connected clients:

```go
// Simplified
func ConsumeAndBroadcast() {
  for msg := range rabbitmq.Consume("feed.created") {
    var event FeedEvent
    json.Unmarshal(msg.Body, &event)
    broadcaster.Broadcast(event)
  }
}
```

This design lets us horizontally scale consumers later.

## 📺 Frontend: Receiving New Feeds

We are going to use TanStack Query for data fetching, generally this is how
TanStack Query works:

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='lordronz-site/blog/tanstack-query'
  alt='tanstack query in a nutshell'
  width={3192}
  height={800}
/>

Using TanStack Query with useInfiniteQuery, we listen for SSE updates:

```ts
const eventSource = new EventSource('http://localhost:8080/events');
eventSource.onmessage = () => setHasNewFeed(true);
```

Then we show a pulse button:

```ts
{hasNewFeed && (
  <Button onClick={refetch} className="animate-pulse">
    🔄 New posts available
  </Button>
)}
```

## 📦 Pagination with Cursor

We use a base64-encoded composite cursor:

```go
// backend
func EncodeCursor(ts int64, id string) string {
  return base64.URLEncoding.EncodeToString([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%d|%s", ts, id)))
}
```

And a smart SQL query with a tie-breaker:

```sql
WHERE (created_at < $1 OR (created_at = $1 AND id < $2))
ORDER BY created_at DESC, id DESC
LIMIT $3
```

This ensures no items are skipped across pages.

## 🎯 Why RabbitMQ?

1. Separation of concerns: API focuses only on DB operations.

2. Reliability: Even if the broadcaster is down, messages are buffered.

3. Scalability: Multiple consumers can process events (analytics, push, etc.).

## 📡 Why SSE over WebSocket? • Easier to implement • Reconnects out of the box •

Great for one-way communication like feeds

WebSocket is great too, but SSE won here for simplicity and performance.

## 🧠 What I Learned • Real-time UX requires backend orchestration.

- Message queues simplify scaling and reliability.
- Cursor pagination is trickier than you think.
- Simplicity matters: SSE > WS for one-way streams.

## 🧵 Final Thoughts

This started with just a scrollable list. But like most engineering journeys,
solving a UI problem exposed gaps in architecture—and that's where the real fun
begins.

So next time someone asks: “Can we show new posts instantly like Twitter?” —
you'll know it's not just a button. It's a system.
