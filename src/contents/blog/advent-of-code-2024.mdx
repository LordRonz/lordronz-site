# Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a calendar of short programming
puzzles that may be completed in any programming language and are appropriate
for a range of skill levels. It is used for practice problems, university
coursework, company training, speed contests, interview preparation, and peer
challenge. You can learn new programming languages or hone your abilities by
solving the puzzles, which are presented every day in December.

I'll be working through the Rust challenges on this blog. I'll be discussing my
methodology and the code I employed to solve the puzzles.

# Day 1: Reconciling Lists

The challenges this year kicked off with an interesting problem: comparing two
lists of numbers to calculate differences and similarities.

## Part 1: Measuring Total Distance

We are tasked with pairing the smallest numbers from two lists and measuring the
differences, summing them up across all pairs.

**Example:** Given these two lists:

```plaintext
Left List:  [3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3]
Right List: [4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]
```

Sorting them results in:

Left List: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] Right List: [3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 9]

Pairing smallest to smallest and calculating the distance:

```plaintext
|1 - 3| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 3| + |3 - 4| + |3 - 5| + |4 - 9| = 11
```

### Solution in code

Here’s my humble solution for Part 1:

```rust
fn part_one(vec_a: &Vec<i64>, vec_b: &Vec<i64>) -> u64 {
    let mut sum: u64 = 0;

    for (a, b) in vec_a.iter().zip(vec_b.iter()) {
        sum += a.abs_diff(*b);
    }

    return sum;
}
```

### Explanation

- The function takes two sorted lists (vec_a and vec_b).
- Using zip, we pair the elements in order and compute the absolute difference
  for each pair.
- The differences are summed up to get the total distance.

## Part 2: Calculating Similarity Score

Now, we calculate a “similarity score” by multiplying each number in the left
list by the number of times it appears in the right list.

**Example**: Using the same lists:

```plaintext
Left List:  [3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3]
Right List: [4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]
```

- 3 appears 3 times in the right list → 3 \* 3 = 9
- 4 appears 1 time in the right list → 4 \* 1 = 4
- 2 appears 0 times → 2 \* 0 = 0
- And so on…

The total similarity score is 31.

### Solution in code

Here’s my solution for Part 2:

```rust
fn part_two(vec_a: &Vec<i64>, vec_b: &Vec<i64>) -> i64 {
    let mut similarity: i64 = 0;

    let mut freqs: HashMap<i64, i64> = HashMap::new();

    for b in vec_b.iter() {
        let count = freqs.entry(*b).or_insert(0);
        *count += 1;
    }

    for a in vec_a.iter() {
        let b_freq = freqs.get(&a).unwrap_or(&0);
        similarity += a * b_freq;
    }

    return similarity;
}
```

### Explanation

- The function takes lists (vec_a and vec_b).
- We create a HashMap to store the frequency of each number in the right list.
- We iterate over the right list and increment the frequency count for each
  number.
- We iterate over the left list and calculate the similarity score by
  multiplying each number by its frequency in the right list.

## Putting It All Together

The following run function ties everything together:

```rust
pub fn run() {
    println!("Day 01:");
    let lines = lines_from_file("./src/day01/input");

    let mut vec_a: Vec<i64> = Vec::new();
    let mut vec_b: Vec<i64> = Vec::new();

    for line in lines.iter() {
        vec_a.push(line[0]);
        vec_b.push(line[1]);
    }

    vec_a.sort();
    vec_b.sort();

    let sum = part_one(&vec_a, &vec_b);
    let similarity = part_two(&vec_a, &vec_b);

    println!("Part 1: {}", sum);
    println!("Part 2: {}", similarity);
}
```

Im using this kinda pattern for each day of the challenge.

### What it does

    1.	Reads input from a file, parsing each line into two lists: vec_a and vec_b.
    2.	Sorts both lists to prepare them for pairing in Part 1.
    3.	Calculates the total distance and similarity score using the two helper functions.
    4.	Prints the results for both parts.

# Day 2: Red-Nosed Reports

This challenge was about analyzing unusual data reports to determine their
safety under specific conditions. Let's break down the problem and my solution
in Rust.

## Part 1: Analyzing Safe Reports

Each report is a list of levels (numbers). A report is considered **safe** if:

1. The levels are either all increasing or all decreasing.
2. The difference between any two adjacent levels is at least 1 and at most 3.

**Example Data:**

```plaintext
7 6 4 2 1: Safe (all decreasing by 1-2).
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe (difference of 5 between 2 and 7).
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe (difference of 4 between 6 and 2).
1 3 2 4 5: Unsafe (switches between increasing and decreasing).
8 6 4 4 1: Unsafe (4 and 4 have no change).
1 3 6 7 9: Safe (all increasing by 1-3).
```

**Task**: Count how many reports are safe according to these rules.

### Solution in code

The is_safe function determines if a report meets the safety criteria.

```rust
fn is_safe(line: &Vec<i64>) -> bool {
    let mut is_safe = true;
    let mut dir = 0;
    for report_pair in line.windows(2) {
        let diff = report_pair[0] - report_pair[1];
        let new_dir = if diff > 0 {
            1
        } else if diff < 0 {
            -1
        } else {
            0
        };

        if diff == 0 || (dir != 0 && dir != new_dir) || diff.abs() > 3 {
            is_safe = false;
            break;
        }
        dir = new_dir;
    }
    is_safe
}
```

### Explanation

- Loops through pairs of adjacent levels using windows(2).
- Tracks the “direction” (increasing, decreasing, or no change).
- Ensures adjacent levels differ by at least 1 and at most 3.

Heres the code for part one:

```rust
fn part_one(lines: &Vec<Vec<i64>>) -> u64 {
    let mut safe_count = 0;
    for line in lines.iter() {
        if is_safe(&line) {
            safe_count += 1;
        }
    }
    safe_count
}
```

## Part 2: Using the Problem Dampener

The “Problem Dampener” allows the removal of one level from an otherwise unsafe
report, potentially making it safe.

**Example Data**:

```plaintext
7 6 4 2 1: Safe without changes.
1 2 7 8 9: Unsafe, even after removing any one level.
9 7 6 2 1: Unsafe, even after removing any one level.
1 3 2 4 5: Safe after removing the second level (3).
8 6 4 4 1: Safe after removing the third level (4).
1 3 6 7 9: Safe without changes.
```

**Task**: Count how many reports are safe with the Problem Dampener.

### Solution in code

This part adds the flexibility to remove a single level and recheck the safety
of the report.

```rust
fn part_two(lines: &Vec<Vec<i64>>) -> u64 {
    let mut safe_count = 0;
    for reports in lines.iter() {
        for i in 0..reports.len() {
            let tolerated_levels: Vec<_> = reports[..i]
                .iter()
                .chain(&reports[i + 1..])
                .cloned()
                .collect();

            if is_safe(&tolerated_levels) {
                safe_count += 1;
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    safe_count
}
```

### Explanation

- Iterates over each report and each level in the report.
- Creates a new list without the current level.
- Checks if the new list is safe.
- Increments the safe count if the report is safe after removing a level.

The run function ties everything together:

```rust
pub fn run() {
    println!("Day 02:");
    let lines = lines_from_file("./src/day02/input");
    // Part A
    let safe_count_1 = part_one(&lines);
    let safe_count_2 = part_two(&lines);

    println!("Part 1: {}", safe_count_1);
    println!("Part 2: {}", safe_count_2);
}
```

# Reflection

The Advent of Code challenges are a great way to practice problem-solving and
learn new programming languages. Rust is a powerful language with a strong
emphasis on safety and performance. I enjoyed solving these puzzles in Rust and
and am eager for the upcoming challenges.
