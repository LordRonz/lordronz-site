## Intro

Now I've written like 3 whole ass retrospective blogs, and I'm not going to
backdown from this tradition, even though the laziness is hitting me hard. So
lazy that the indonesian language is not even written. Last year's retro was
written mostly by AI, and I do think it was pretty silly. So this year, I'm
going to write it myself, just because I got myself more spare time to write it
(took lots of leave from work). I mean I still use AI, but mostly just for the
autocomplete because usually the AI knows what I'm about to write (I'm not a
clanker).

Enough yapping, here we go, 2025 retrospective.

## Work and projects

To be honest I kinda forgor most events happened about work. Like of course I
worked a lot, like aside from my full-time job, I did some projects, with my
colleagues. Sadly there's this particular project that I was working on and was
ambitious about it, but since it's like not paid and was really just like a
spare-time project, I didn't manage to finish it this year.

Every week I said to myself, that I will try to finish it, but then I remembered
other works that I need to do, and then I just forgor about it.

The project was kinda cool tho, it uses AI (yes it's llm wrapper) and we also
tried to monetize it, I even registered for a [Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
account. Someday I will finish it for real (hopefully), and shared it in a new
blog post.

Work wise, it wasn't that interesting, I mean I just worked hard, and that's
basically it. Had some sharing sessions with my colleagues, and learned a lot
from them.

## AI and programming

AI is a bubble. Nahh just kidding, not gonna talk about that here. AI is a big
thing in 2025, and I obviously utilized it a lot, like a lot more now than last
year.

### Vibe coding with Cursor IDE

Starting this year, I'm using [Cursor IDE](https://www.cursor.com/) for
literally everything. Mobile apps, web apps, web servers, scripts, you name it.
It's a great tool, and I'm glad I discovered it and moved on from VSCode. Yes I
know it's just a fork of VSCode, but idc what you guys think. I like it, and
it's working great for me.

I tried to use Trae before, when it was still in beta. It was good but I still
encountered bugs here and there. Once their beta ended, they immediately limit
the shi out of the usage, so I stopped using it. If I were to pay for an IDE,
why not just use Cursor? which was like the most popular AI-powered IDE at that
time. Then I got their pro plan, and guess what? The auto mode is just crazy,
like it makes me feel like it won't run out of usage. And if we don't use auto
mode, there are lots of selections to choose from. Latest and greatest popular
models are almost always available, and they got their own model called
Composer, though I'm not sure if it's as good as the other models.

Of course, knowing the project context is important. If we understand the
project and requirements, we can make better prompts and better instructions.
It's also important to understand the code that was generated by the AI, and
then we may modify it to fit our needs, or even write a follow up prompt.

### Bun.js

Yes, I tried using [Bun.js](https://bun.sh/) just because of the hype in Twitter
(Sybau I'm still calling it twitter not X).

It's really interesting to me that the Bun team literally wrote the entire
JavaScript runtime from scratch, with Zig. Their main selling point is that Bun
is blazing fast, and they don't lie.

They also have their own libraries for managing S3, and is compatible with many
cloud providers. I personally start using it for this very repo. Once I heard
that
[Vercel already support the Bun runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/functions/runtimes/bun),
I immediately migrate to it. I guess it's mostly because of FOMO, but it's a
good tool regardless.

## Money and wealth

This year I grinded a lot, and managed to save some money and invest it in the
stock market, both US and Indonesian stocks. Lately, I discovered a good
community that made me interested in learning more about trading in stock
market. I did make some profit, and a bit of loss (learned my lesson lol). I can
see myself getting more serious in trading in stock market in 2026. Hopefully I
can make more profit for real this time.

I also learned more about credit card and its benefits. I've had credit card
since like 2023 but I never really used it, since I don't really understand the
benefits of using it. Basically we can get cashback or miles from using it, just
need to be mindful about the spending and payment due date, so that we don't get
charged with interest.

## Misc

I will put things that I found interesting but don't really fit into the other
categories here.

Starting this year, I'm using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) to enhance my
productivity. It's a really, I mean really good tool for macOS users. I can peek
my GitLab pipeline status from it, and also have nice clipboard manager built
in. They got tons of extensions in the store, and I've experimented with some of
them. One of my favorite is the image converter tool, because I often convert
images to webp. You can also perform simple math operations, unit conversion,
and currency conversion directly from the command. There are lots of other
things that you can do with Raycast, and I'm pretty sure that I haven't even
explored them all.

Another tool that I discovered this year is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/).
It's a really nice note-taking app that is very similar to notion, but it is
free, lighter, and can be used offline. The notes are stored in a markdown file,
and we can specify the directory and file name. We also can sync the notes to
the cloud, but I'm not using that feature. It's also very customizable. There
are tons of themes and plugins from the community.

I watched several anime and movies this year, and one of the most interesting
ones is Jojo's Bizarre Adventure series. What else do you expect? It's a really
good watch, especially part 5 (we don't call it season here). It's really a
bizarre and golden experience to watch. Also I hated that One punch man season 3
got violated badly by JC Staff. No need to talk about it it's just horrendous.
The manga is such a masterpiece, and the anime is a heresy. But hey at least the
memes are hilarious tho.

Lastly, I want to give a shoutout to my girlfriend. She's been a great support
to me this year. Always gave me motivation to keep going. Hopefully we can spend
more time together in the future.

## Outro

2025 was a year of growth for me. Learned a lot, discovered a lot of new tools,
and I'm glad I was able to learn a bit about trading in stock market. This year
I didn't write as many blogs as I wanted to, hopefully I can write more in 2026
(or 2027, and so on).
