# The story

Once upon a time, I applied for a job. I got invited to an online test, and I
got to the next round, which was the HR interview. I basically nailed the first
interview with the HR.

But then I got to proceed to the next interview, which was the technical
interview (live coding). I was given a problem to solve. It's basically a
problem about binary tree.

They gave me this picture:

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='lordronz-site/blog/pathsumii1_qcaenq'
  alt='binary tree'
  width={492}
  height={421}
/>

Basically we need to find the sum for each paths, and then compare the sum with
the target sum. If it's equal to the target sum, we append the path to the
result.

# The cope

<CloudinaryImg
  mdx
  publicId='lordronz-site/blog/Copium-PNG-Photo_inixrm'
  alt='coping'
  width={320}
  height={388}
/>

Well long story short, I spent like an hour trying to solve it. I was nearly
able to solve it (mfw I'm coping), but yea I didn't make it. I mean it's not too
hard, but I was just too nervous and I messed up. I knew I need to use DFS to
solve it, but I messed up the implementation. And yup I knew that I was gonna
fail the interview.

Well my feelings were hurt, and I though why the hell I need to do this? Why I
need to waste my time on this? Like I've worked in this industry before and I
never had to do things with binary tree. Like I bet even when I was accepted in
the company, I would never had to do things with binary tree. I will prolly deal
with API endpoints and database queries. It won't need DFS or BFS or anything
like that.

Then at some point, I decided to do some exercise in leetcode. I specifically
looking for the binary tree related problems. It was ironic since I was trying
to avoid doing things with binary tree, but then I was doing it anyway.

Maybe I did like 3 or 4 problems, and then I stumbled upon the exact same
problem I had in the interview. Like if only I had done this earlier, I would
have been able to solve it. But then I thought, bro I never deal with DFS in my
work before. Why is the industry asking me to do this?

But when you think about it, maybe if they don't use this kinda problem, it will
be difficult to filter out the candidates. In this economy where there are so
many people applying for the same job, they need to find a way to filter out the
candidates. And this is one of the ways to do it. That and maybe the company
just doesn't want to hire you.

Don't get me wrong, I do think that leetcode grinding maybe beneficial for
coders, since it develops your problem solving skills. But I don't have plenty
of time to do it, and it's getting kinda tedious when doing it for too long.
(Bro insisted it's not a skill issue) My favorite type of question/problem for
technical interview is the one where you're solving real life problems, like
finding issues in the code, or optimizing something in the code, or how to
design a system to handle a certain problem. This kind of problem is where AI
might be struggling to solve, and it needs human's creativity to solve it. At
least for now...

# Conclusion

So the conclusion is, coding interview is in the gray area of bullshitery. Yes
this might be an L take from me.
