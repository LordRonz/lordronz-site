## Introduction

In the vast world of the internet, the goal for web developers is to reach users
worldwide. One way to do this is by making your Next.js app multilingual. Enter
the world of Internationalization (i18n), where your app can speak the language
of users from around the world. In this blog, we'll explore how to add i18n to
your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project, making sure your app can be used by
people all over the globe. This blog will cover the usage of i18n in Next.js
with Page router.

## What is i18n in Next.js

Consider your web application as a medium capable of engaging users across
diverse global regions. Guaranteeing a hospitable and intuitive encounter for
all necessitates communication in their native tongue. Internationalization
(i18n) involves tailoring your application to accommodate various languages and
locales. Next.js has
[several options](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)
for you to provide robust tools and functionalities to facilitate this. For
simplicity, this blog will focus on
[next-intl](https://next-intl-docs.vercel.app/) as I have actually used it in a
production app. It is well maintained and supports both Page Router and App
Router.

## Using next-intl

Before actually using the next-intl, we should install it by running

```bash
npm install next-intl
```

or if you're using yarn

```bash
yarn add next-intl
```

or if you're using pnpm

```bash
pnpm add next-intl
```

### Internationalization routing

Refer to
[the official docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/internationalization)
for detailed explanation

You can start by simply adding i18n configs to your `next.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    // These are all the locales you want to support in
    // your application
    locales: ['en-US', 'id-ID'],
    // This is the default locale you want to be used when visiting
    // a non-locale prefixed path e.g. `/hello`
    defaultLocale: 'en-US',
    // This is a list of locale domains and the default locale they
    // should handle (these are only required when setting up domain routing)
    // Note: subdomains must be included in the domain value to be matched e.g. "fr.example.com".
    domains: [
      {
        domain: 'example.com',
        defaultLocale: 'en-US',
      },
      {
        domain: 'example.id',
        defaultLocale: 'id-ID',
        // an optional http field can also be used to test
        // locale domains locally with http instead of https
        http: true,
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

The locale identifier used above is English as spoken in the US, and Indonesian
as spoken in Indonesia. You can check your locale
[here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/office_standards/ms-oe376/6c085406-a698-4e12-9d4d-c3b0ee3dbc4a)

If you specify default locale, it doesn't have a prefix.

```ts {2-9}
customAxios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const authHeader = getAuthHeader();
  if (authHeader === null || authHeader === undefined) return config;

  config.headers = {
    ...config.headers,
    Authorization: authHeader,
  };
  return config;
});
```

### Automatic locale detection

By default, next.js will try to redirect a user to the locale prefixed path if
using the sub-path routing. You can disable this behavior by using this config.

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    localeDetection: false,
  },
};
```

### Custom routing rules

You can utilize
[next.js middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/middleware)
to customize your own routing rules.

Suppose you want to automatically redirect users according to their default
browser language, but you also don't want to redirect them if they are already
on the prefixed locale path. To give you more context, suppose we have a user
named LeBron. LeBron's browser language is English, so if he visits
`basketball.com`, he should be redirected to `basketball.com/en`. However, if he
is fluent in Indonesian and visits `basketball.com/id`, he should not be
redirected. This can be achieved by using the following `next.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  i18n: {
    locales: ['default', 'en', 'id'],
    defaultLocale: 'default',
  },
  // Other configurations.
};
```

We use the `default` locale here as a flag that the user visits the website
without a prefix. Now we can put this in `middleware.ts`

```ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import type { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

// Regex to check whether something has an extension, e.g. .jpg
const PUBLIC_FILE = /\.(.*)$/;

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const { nextUrl, headers } = request;

  // Early return if it is a public file such as an image or an api call
  if (
    nextUrl.pathname.startsWith('/_next') ||
    nextUrl.pathname.includes('/api/') ||
    PUBLIC_FILE.test(nextUrl.pathname)
  ) {
    return;
  }
  // Proceed without redirection if on a localized path
  const pathname = request.url.split('/')[3].toLowerCase();
  if (pathname.startsWith('en') || pathname.startsWith('id')) {
    return;
  }

  // Cloned url to work with
  const url = nextUrl.clone();

  // Client language, defaults to en
  const language =
    headers
      .get('accept-language')
      ?.split(',')?.[0]
      .split('-')?.[0]
      .toLowerCase() ||
    nextUrl.locale.split('-')[0] ||
    'en';
  try {
    // redirect to /en if the language is en or default
    if (language === 'en' || language === 'default') {
      url.pathname = `/en${nextUrl.pathname}`;
      return NextResponse.redirect(url);
    }

    // redirect to /id if the language is id
    if (language === 'id') {
      url.pathname = `/id${nextUrl.pathname}`;
      return NextResponse.redirect(url);
    }

    return;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    {
      source: '/((?!api|_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
      missing: [
        { type: 'header', key: 'next-router-prefetch' },
        { type: 'header', key: 'purpose', value: 'prefetch' },
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

You can try experimenting with this configurations, by changing your default
browser language. Note that we must ignore some routes such as the api route,
\_next static, and images. If we don't do this then undefined behavior will
happen because for every single file it will execute this middleware.

You can combine this with language switcher for the user if the preferred
language is different than the browser language.

## Summary

Next.js supports multiple ways of implementing i18n. One of those is the
next-intl, which is explored in this blog. It comes with a lot of features out
of the box, and we can further customize it by using next.js's middleware.
