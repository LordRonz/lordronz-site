## Introduction

[Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is a promise-based HTTP Client for
node.js and the browser. It is isomorphic (= it can run in the browser and
nodejs with the same codebase). It is widely used by web applications to do HTTP
requests. The reason why it is so popular is because of its feature-rich
library. One of its feature is
[Interceptors](https://axios-http.com/docs/interceptors). In this blog, I will
demonstrate simple usage of it with JWT authentication.

## What is Axios Interceptors

Axios interceptors are the default configuration that are added automatically to
every request or response that a user receives. In other words, you can define
what you want to do before doing any requests or after response. Some use case
of interceptors are to get JWT token and attach it to the request header, or
checking status code of a response and do whatever suits your application.

## Using Axios Interceptors

Before actually using the interceptors, we should create a custom axios instance
by calling `create` as shown below.

```ts
const customAxios = axios.create({
  baseURL: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL,
});
```

Here I use `baseURL` options, you can use
[other options](https://axios-http.com/docs/config_defaults) as well.

After creating the instance, use interceptors like this.

```ts
customAxios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const authHeader = getAuthHeader();
  if (authHeader === null || authHeader === undefined) return config;

  config.headers = {
    ...config.headers,
    Authorization: authHeader,
  };
  return config;
});
```

We pass the function that will be executed before any request. Here I am getting
the JWT token and passing it in the request header. The function passed have
config object in the parameter, we need to modify this.

Another example is when you want to get JWT access token when the token expired
by using refresh token, we can use HTTP status code returned.

```ts
customAxios.interceptors.response.use(
  function (response) {
    return response;
  },
  async function (error) {
    const originalRequest = error.config;
    if (
      loginUrls.includes(originalRequest.url) &&
      error.response.status === 401
    ) {
      return Promise.reject(error);
    }
    // TODO: please update this response status to 401 when BE already give correct response status on token expired
    if (error.response.status !== 400 && !originalRequest._retry) {
      originalRequest._retry = true;
      const token = Cookies.get('accessToken');
      const rToken = Cookies.get('refreshToken');
      let usedToken = token || contextToken;
      const usedRToken = rToken || contextRToken;
      const now = moment().unix();
      let expiry: number = now;
      if (usedToken) {
        const decodeToken = jwtDecode<JwtPayload>(usedToken);
        expiry = decodeToken.exp - 3600;
      }
      if (expiry < now && usedRToken) {
        return refreshingToken(usedRToken).then((reNew) => {
          usedToken = reNew.accessToken;
          setToken(usedToken);
          setRefreshToken(reNew.refreshToken);
          Cookies.set('accessToken', usedToken);
          Cookies.set('refreshToken', reNew.refreshToken);
          Cookies.set('googleToken', reNew.googleToken);
          customAxios.defaults.headers.common.Authorization = `Bearer ${usedToken}`;
          return customAxios(originalRequest);
        });
      }
    }
    return Promise.reject(error);
  }
);
```

### Remove an interceptors

If you need to remove an interceptor later you can do it like this.

```ts
const myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {
  /*...*/
});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
```

## Summary

So now you have learned how to use interceptors effectively. I suggest you to
try experimenting with it, because experience is the best teacher, ah me so wise
.\_. The [documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) is also very nice,
you can check it out!
