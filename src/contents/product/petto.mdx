## Introduction

Working with virtual environment in Python is tedious for some sussy bakas. In
this article we will use [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). It
is a module that should be included when you install Python.

## Venv official definition

> The venv module supports creating lightweight “virtual environments”, each
> with their own independent set of Python packages installed in their site
> directories. A virtual environment is created on top of an existing Python
> installation, known as the virtual environment's “base” Python, and may
> optionally be isolated from the packages in the base environment, so only
> those explicitly installed in the virtual environment are available.

You can read the documentation if you want to...

### Definition simplified

I know the explanation above is too technical for some sussy bakas, but here is
my attempt to explain it.

You install Python on your machine. This includes some standard packages. For a
lot of projects though, you'll have to install additional packages (using
[PIP](https://pypi.org/) for example). As you build more, and more complex
projects, it becomes hard to track which projects use which packages. Also:
different projects may use different versions of the same package.

To make this more structured, you should create a virtual environment for each
project. This basically contains a copy of your original Python installation,
and you can add all your project-specific packages here. Other projects won't be
affected. Take it a step further, and you arrive at Docker containers. These
create isolated environments, containers, not only for your Python
installations, but for all project dependencies. This makes it very easy to
transfer your project to another machine as well. You just have to clone the
Docker container.

Enough talking, let's see how to do it.

## Create a virtual environment

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

The command will create a folder called `.venv`. Inside the folder, there is
some subfolders and files that you should not be worried about.

But the important file is inside the bin folder, called `activate`. This is an
executable, which will activate the virtual environment.

## Activate the virtual environment

```sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The command will activate the virtual environment, so now if you have installed
Numpy for example, you will lose it in the current env, because it creates a
clean state of Python.

### Installing packages in the virtual environment

Now I'm going to install numpy on my new venv, let's do it.

```sh
pip install numpy
```

Now you can use numpy, but what if you want to tell people and your future self
that this project uses numpy? The answer is by creating `requirements.txt` file.

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now you should have a new file called `requirements.txt` that lists all your
installed Python packages. If you want to install the packages listed in the
`requirements.txt`, you can use the command below

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Of course, we can use other tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to
manage packages easily, but I tends to stick with the `requirements.txt` file
whenever possible.

You can add some more packages as you need, and the steps above are also doable,
unless there is a dependency errors. Maybe I will explain this in another blog.

## Deactivate the virtual environment

To deactivate the virtual environment means you are going back to the main
Python environment. You can achieve this by entering this command

```sh
deactivate
```

## Summary

So now you have learned how to use the virtual environment in Python! I suggest
you to try experimenting with it, because experience is the best teacher, ah me
so wise .\_.
